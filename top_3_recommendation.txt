My first recommendation would be the FAST detector with BRIEF descriptor. This is the fastest
combination, averaging about 3 milliseconds. Additionally I would recommend the 2 combinations of
the ORB detector with either the BRIEF or BRISK descriptors. These combinations are still
relatively fast, averaging about 7-8 milliseconds. However, they result in a significantly lower
number of keypoint matches, around 65-80, compared to FAST with BRIEF, which results in around 320.
This lower number of keypoint matches means less processing is required in future steps.
